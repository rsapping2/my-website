# Top 10 Job Boards for Tech and Remote Work

### [1. LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)
It's LinkedIn, what else is there to say? It has a little bit of everything. Mostly free, with some premium features.

### [2. Indeed](https://www.indeed.com)
One of the largest job aggregators worldwide.  
  
**Pro:** Very large volume of listings.

### [5. Remote OK](https://remoteok.com)
A highly tailored to remote jobs featuring tech, marketing, and support roles with filters and salary estimates. It's worth noting that I had issues signing up. The Outlook email I had used successfully for other accounts was flagged as "bounced," and I was asked to use a different email. While attempting to do so, each username I tried became unavailable, which made the process even more frustrating.  
  
**Pro:** Keep updated includes salary data.  
**Con:** Some listings may be freelance or contract only, which isn’t ideal for all.

**Pro:** Great for local tech hub opportunities and community insights.  
**Con:** Limited to specific metropolitan areas.  

### [9. Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm)
Known for its company reviews and salary transparency, Glassdoor also has extensive job listings for tech and other fields.  
  
**Pro:** Insight into company culture and compensation before applying.  
**Con:** Job listings can be less comprehensive than dedicated boards.  

### [10. Stack Overflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs)

#### Ranked 1–10 Explained

The platforms above are ranked in the order I personally found them most helpful. This ranking reflects a combination of factors including: how easy each site was to navigate, the quality and relevance of the job listings I found, how widely each platform is used within my professional network, and reviews and/or feedback I've come across from others. While traffic and job volume are important, my focus was on the actual user experience and usefulness when actively searching for remote and tech related roles, for myself.  
  
For the job boards listed below, I briefly looked at them, but didn't sign up for all of them or use them personally. If any pique your interest, I recommend taking a look at them.
