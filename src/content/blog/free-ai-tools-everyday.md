# AI Tools

You've probably heard people talking about ChatGPT, AI assistants, vibe coding or prompt AI tools. Maybe you've seen coworkers or friends using them to write emails, brainstorm ideas, or answer questions. But what exactly are these tools, and how can you start using them for free?

If you're new to AI tools, this guide will help you understand what they are, which ones are worth trying, and how to get started—all without needing any technical background.

## What is an LLM? (In Simple Terms)

LLM stands for **Large Language Model**. Think of it as a very advanced autocomplete system that's been trained on a massive amount of text from the internet, books, articles, and more.

Here's the simple way to think about it:

- **You type a question or request** (this is called a "prompt")
- **The AI reads what you wrote** and uses its training to predict what a helpful response would be
- **It generates text** that answers your question or completes your task

It's like having a conversation with someone who has read millions of books and can help you with writing, research, brainstorming, coding, and problem solving. The AI doesn't "think" like humans do, it's pattern matching on an enormous scale but the results can be incredibly useful. I've mostly only used it through cursor, which is another topic for another time.

### What Can You Use AI For?

The list is honestly pretty long, but here's what I've found most useful:

- **Writing help**: Emails, social media posts, cover letters, blog posts, resume review
- **Research**: Quick explanations of complex topics, summaries of articles
- **Brainstorming**: Ideas for projects, names, solutions to problems
- **Learning**: Understanding new concepts, getting step-by-step explanations
- **Planning**: Trip itineraries, meal plans, workout routines
- **Problem Solving**: Troubleshooting issues, getting advice on decisions

I know someone who uses it to write dating app messages (apparently it works?). Another friend uses it to help with meal planning. The use cases are kind of endless once you start thinking about it.

## The Best Free AI Tools Available Today

I've tried pretty much all of them, and here's what's actually worth your time:

### 1. ChatGPT (by OpenAI)

This is the one everyone knows about, and for good reason. It launched in late 2022 and basically started the whole AI chatbot craze.

The free version gives you access to GPT-3.5, which is honestly pretty solid for most things. You get unlimited conversations, can ask questions, get writing help, and there are mobile apps if you want to use it on the go.

Getting started is simple: just go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com), sign up with an email (or use your Google account), and start chatting. That's it.

I use this one the most because it's reliable and handles general purpose tasks well. The free version uses GPT-3.5, which isn't as advanced as the paid GPT-4, but it's still really good. The only downside is that during peak times, you might hit usage limits. But honestly, I've rarely had that happen.

### 2. Google Gemini (formerly Bard)

Google's answer to ChatGPT. It used to be called Bard, but they rebranded it to Gemini.

The free tier gives you access to Gemini Pro, which integrates nicely with Google services. You can generate images in some regions, and there's voice input support if you're into that.

Just head to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com) and sign in with your Google account. If you're already in the Google ecosystem, this one makes a lot of sense.

I find it particularly good for research tasks since it can tap into Google's knowledge base. The image generation is a nice bonus if it's available where you are. The main catch is you need a Google account, and some features vary by region (which is annoying, but that's how it goes).

### 3. Claude (by Anthropic)

This one is interesting. Anthropic created Claude with a focus on being "helpful, harmless, and honest" all of which sounds like marketing, but in practice, it does feel a bit better than some of the others.

The free version uses Claude 3 Sonnet, and the standout feature here is the long context window. I've pasted entire articles into it and asked for summaries, and it handles it without breaking a sweat. It's really good at analysis and breaking down complex topics. I willl mention though, it adds emojis to everything, which can be annoying.

Sign up at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) with an email and you're good to go.

I use Claude when I need to analyze articcles, code or want more nuanced responses. It's less likely to give you that "here's a generic answer" solution. The downside is the free tier has usage limits, and if you want the most advanced model (Claude 3 Opus), you'll need to pay. But the free version is still really capable.

### 4. Microsoft Copilot

Here's the thing about Microsoft Copilot: it gives you GPT-4 for free. That's actually a big deal because GPT-4 is usually behind a paywall. Plus, you get free image generation, which is nice.

You can use it at [copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com) or directly in Microsoft Edge (if you're one of those people who uses Edge). The basic features don't even require an account, which is convenient.

I'll be honest, I don't use this one as much, but if you're already in the Microsoft ecosystem or want GPT-4 without paying, it's worth checking out. Some features do require a Microsoft account, and there are usage limits, but for most people, it's plenty.

### 5. Grok

This is Elon Musk's AI assistant, which means it comes with... well, with the Elon experience. This is the AI you have likely heard about in the news...for saying edgy things. It's known for being more conversational and less filtered than the others, and it can access real time information from X (Twitter).

You can check it out at [x.ai](https://x.ai) or through X itself. I've tried it, and it's alright.

## How to Actually Use These Things

Okay, so you've picked a tool (or you're still deciding). Here's how to actually get value out of it:

### Start Simple

Don't try to do everything at once. Pick one tool. I'd recommend ChatGPT or Gemini to start with and just mess around with it. Ask it stupid questions. See what happens. 

Signing up takes like 60 seconds. Enter your email, check your inbox, verify it, and you're done. It's not rocket science. Note: You can likely use the prompts without signing up, and to play around, thata is just fine.

### Your First Prompts Should Be Boring

Seriously. Don't try to write your magnum opus on day one. Start with something simple:

- "What's a good recipe for chicken dinner for 4 people?"
- "How long do you boil an egg in the microwave?"
- "Help me write a text message to cancel lunch plans with a friend."
- "What should I say in a thank you note for a birthday gift?"

These aren't exciting, but they'll help you get a feel for how the tool works. Once you're comfortable, you can get more creative.

### The Secret: Be Specific

Here's where most people mess up. They ask vague questions and get vague answers. The AI isn't a mind reader. It needs context.

Bad: "Write an email asking about time off"  
Good: "Write a professional email to my manager requesting time off next Friday, keeping it brief and friendly."

See the difference? The more context you give, the better the response. It's like talking to a person, if you want good advice, you need to explain the situation.

Same thing with planning: "Help me plan a trip to the Beaach" will get you generic tourist stuff. But "Help me plan a 3 day trip to the Beach in March for two people, including budget friendly restaurant recommendations" will actually be useful.

### Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Changes

The AI doesn't get offended. Ask it to make things shorter, more formal, add examples, whatever. It's a conversation, not a one and done thing.

### Experiment

Try different stuff. Ask it to explain concepts you don't understand. Use it to brainstorm. Have it help you write or edit. Paste long articles and ask for summaries. The more you use it, the better you'll get at using it.

## A Few Things to Keep in Mind

**Talk to it like a person.** Well, sort of. You can ask follow up questions and have a back and forth. It's not like using a search engine where you type and get results, it's more like texting a friend who happens to know a lot.

**Don't trust everything it says.** AI can make mistakes or just make stuff up. It "hallucinates" (make up information that sounds plausible, and sites made up sources as well). I've caught it giving me wrong code examples, incorrect dates, and made up facts. In some video I've seen, people have showning it has made up laws, and cases to support it. Always verify important stuff, especially for coding, medical, legal, or financial advice. It's a tool, not a replacement for critical thinking.

**It's a starting point, not the finish line.** AI is great for drafts and ideas, but you should always review, edit, and personalize what it gives you. I've always had to update outputs from the AI. It's a collaborator, not a replacement.

**Different tools for different jobs.** I use ChatGPT for general stuff, Claude for analyzing and writting code, and Gemini when I need research or a second opinion. Experiment and see what works for you.

**Watch what you share.** Don't paste passwords, sensitive personal info, or work related material into these tools. They use your conversations to train their models (unless you have a paid plan and opt out), so keep that in mind.

## Questions People Often Ask

**Do I need to pay?**  
No. All of these have free tiers that are genuinely useful. The paid versions are nice if you need advanced features, but the free ones are fine for most people.

**Which one should I use?**  
Depends on what you need. ChatGPT is the most versatile and popular. Gemini is great if you're already in Google's ecosystem. Claude is my go to for analyzing coding. Microsoft Copilot gives you GPT-4 for free, which is cool. Try a couple and see what clicks.

**Is my data private?**  
Most services use your conversations to train their models. Check the privacy policies if you're concerned. For sensitive stuff, either use paid tiers (which often have better privacy guarantees) or just don't share it. Common sense applies here.

**Can I use this at work?**  
Lots of people do, but check your company's policies first. Some places have restrictions, especially around confidential information. Don't get yourself in trouble.

**Will AI replace my job?**  
This is the question everyone's asking, and the honest answer is: it's complicated. Jobs are shifting, not just disappearing. In tech, AI can handle a lot of routine coding that entry level developers used to do. But that means the industry needs more people who can design systems, make architectural decisions, and solve complex problems the stuff AI can't do yet.

The same thing is happening everywhere, routine tasks are getting automated, but roles that need human judgment, creativity, and expertise are still valuable. The key is adapting and developing skills that work with AI, not against it. It's not about being replaced, but it's about leveraging its use.

## Just Start Already

Look, the best way to learn this stuff is to just do it. Stop reading about it and go try it.

Pick one tool (ChatGPT or Gemini are good starting points), sign up (takes like 2 minutes), and ask it three questions about something you're actually curious about. Then try one practical thing, ask for a recipe, brainstorm some ideas, whatever.

Once you're comfortable, check out the other tools. You don't need any technical knowledge. Just type what you're thinking and see what happens. Worst case scenario, you waste 10-15 minutes. Best case, you find a tool that makes your life easier.
